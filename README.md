# SQL-Cleaning-Covid-Data

This is my first Portfolio project where I trim down and clean the covid data set using SQL. 

## Source

https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

## Steps - Excel

- Downloaded data set is opened in Excel workbook format
- I do some basic formatting that includes giving meaningful column names, remove some columns which I will not require for my intended work. 
- Perform data validation by ensuring the data is correct. Eg: Data in date field should be date and Location field has only country names.
- Load the data in a oracle db to use SQL queries to perfom some more cleansing. The reason I chose to use a DB at this point is becasue it is easier as we are dealing with a large dataset.
